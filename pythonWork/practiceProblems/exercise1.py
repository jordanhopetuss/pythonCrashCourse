# *Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers. Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.*

# Part 1 Values:


number1 = 20
number2 = 30

if number1 * number2 <= 1000:
    print(number1 * number2)
else:
    print(number1 + number2)

# Expected Output: The result is 600

# Part 2 Values:

number1 = 40
number2 = 30
if number1 * number2 <= 1000:
    print(number1 * number2)
else:
    print(number1 + number2)
# Expected Output: The result is 70
