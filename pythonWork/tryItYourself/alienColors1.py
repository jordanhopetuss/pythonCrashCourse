# Aliens shot down in your game. Creat a variable called alienColor and assign it a value of "green" "yellow" or "red"

alienColor = ["green", "yellow", "red"]

if "green" in alienColor:
    print("5 points earned! ")
if "blue" in alienColor:
    print("Lose 2 points. ")
if "red" in alienColor:
    print("\nLose your next turn. ")
